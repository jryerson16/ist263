        <h2>Life at the Jersey Shore</h2>
            <p>Hello there! My name is Jacob Ryerson, and I am a sophmore at Syracuse University, studying Information Managment and Technology. One of the most important things about myself is that I am from the Jersey Shore. I have lived here my entire life and have loved every second here. As you can see on the map, I was born in Red Bank and live in a town just 5 minutes away.</p>
