            <p>One of the absolute best things about living on the Jersey Shore is the miles and miles of beaches that stretch up the entire eastern coast of the state. Growing up the three most popular beaches that my family and I went to were called Long Beach Island, Long Branch, and Sandy Hook. I would spend entire days at the beach, playing sports with my friends and swimming in the ocean. I can truly say that the beach was a massive part of my childhood</p>

            <p>The beaches, however, are not the only thing to do when visiting the Jersey Shore. There are still plenty of things to do when the beach gets too hot. Here are some examples of things that my friends and I would like to do on our days off</p>
